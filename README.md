# ðŸŽ¨ GSAP Practice Projects

A collection of small projects built using [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/), created as part of my learning journey into web animations. Each project explores a different concept or feature of GSAP â€” from scroll-based effects to SVG and cursor animations.
